    <p> I have always had a strong curiosity for business, I am driven to understand the intricacies of different business models
        and learn what seperates successful businesses from the unsuccessful in different industries. Further, I am always
        looking to expand my skill set which has driven me to learn to code in my spare time. I am particularly fascinated by innovations
        in the agricultural sector as precision agriculture moves the industry toward 'Agriculture 4.0'. The coming together of advances in machine learning,
        artificial inteligence, and biotechnology are set to create enourmous value in the coming years - it is this which fuels my professional and professional interest
        as I build a career in the industry.
